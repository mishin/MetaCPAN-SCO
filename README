search.cpan.org on MetaCPAN

This is an attempt to refcreate the look-and-feel of http://search.cpan.org/ using the
MetaCPAN API as a back-end. https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/

the same back-end that powers the fancier https://metacpan.org/

There are a number of objectives:

1) Some people complain that MetaCPAN.org is too fancy for them and they prefer the look-and-feel of search.cpan.org
2) It will be able to provide a feedback to the MetaCPAN authors for the features that might be still missing in MetaCPAN
3) This can be an interesting project to follow and explain with http://perlmaven.com/pro articles
