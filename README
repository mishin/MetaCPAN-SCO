search.cpan.org clone based on MetaCPAN API

This is an attempt to recreate the look-and-feel of http://search.cpan.org/ using the
MetaCPAN API as a back-end. https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/

For objectives, plans, and a description of what the site, and the code behind it should look like see
http://perlmaven.com/search-cpan-org

For a live version of this application visit http://sco.perlmaven.com/


Development environment:
------------------------

* Install the prerequisites via Makefile.PL
* Run bin/fetch.pl to fetch some meta-meta-data from MetaCPAN::API
* Run plackup -r
* Borwse to http://localhost:5000/


Enhancements
--------------

Various places where the clone differs from the real sco that can be considered enhancements.

The permalink in the top-right corner of
http://sco.perlmaven.com/~szabgab/CPAN-Test-Dummy-SCO-Special-0.04/lib/CPAN/Test/Dummy/SCO/Special.pm
links directly to the permanent url and not to /perldoc?
